# Drive Safe

* Either your app generates data or it uses some data, in our case, for our app to function, 
we need some data to operate on, we need data to train our model to work efficiently for Indian roads.

 * To work on our application, we needed to check, if the solution we are proposing, was working at all,
 so we created a bare minimum prototype using AR, Unity3d & Vuforia SDK, to check, if the app was worth making.

* For creation of the prototype, we initially collected data and by using Vuforia SDK checked for
unique features via which AR Camera can recognize the potholes or lane.

* Then, we decided on the 3D model to display for pothole detection & lane assist as 3-D models 
are easier to see than that of 2-D models.

* After collecting some more data, we worked to refine our model even more to calibrate it according to Indiaâ€™s topology.
